### The Problem We Solve

In todayâ€™s time, the discussion on mental wellbeing has become vital. This becomes even more important when it comes to teenagers. 20% of adolescents may experience a mental health problem in any given year. 50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24.However, most of them are not able to convey their problems to anyone due to various reasons like embarrasment,nervousness etc and hence they suffer.Our software "SAMWAD" as the name suggests solves this communication gap between the students and their mentors by maintaining their anonymity.

Our idea proposes that every student in an institution should fill the psychometric test which will be in the google forms format.The questions have been prepared after a lot of research and are evaluated using specialised algorithms and with appropriate data collection, can be substitued using Neural Networks.Once the evaluation is completed,a detailed analysis and a list of activities,motivational video specific to a class is provided to the respective teacher.

The software generates a Happiness score for each institution on the basis of the survey they take from their students.This score provides a scale for judging various instituions on the basis of their comprehensive measure of well being of its students.So they will make evry effort to be on the top of the rankings and hence adhere to practices beneficial for its students.

In a huge diversified country such as India,the classroom consists of students coming from various socio-economic backgrounds,our surveys also cover questions on discrimination and informs the concerned teacher that such a practice is taking place in the class.

Our software flow is as shown:-
